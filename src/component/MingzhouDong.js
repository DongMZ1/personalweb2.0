                Since beginning my journey as a full-stack developer nearly 1 year. I have made 2 projects(MERN).
                <br />
                I'm quietly confident and naturally curious.
                <br />
                I am a self-driven person who can deliver strong programming, communication, and analytical skills within
                 the development team.
